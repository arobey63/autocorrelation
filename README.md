# Autocorrelation and Extinction Risk
Forecasting species persistence often relies on combining thermal performance curves and statistical distributions of expected temperatures without any consideration for the order in which those temperatures occur. In this study, we instead incorporate thermal performance curves with population dynamics to elucidate the relationship between the sequence of temperature events (driven by temporal autocorrelation) and extinction risk. We show that the permutation of temperatures determines the extent of risk, particularly as thermal regimes grow warmer, more variable, and more autocorrelated. These results, demonstrated across both idealized and empirical thermal performance and temperature time series data, are robust to seasonal and diurnal cycles and show that we may be overlooking substantial risks posed by the intensification of heatwave regimes. Our model offers new tools for testing the robustness of TPCs and emphasizes the importance of looking beyond temporally blind metrics, like mean population size or average thermal distributions, for forecasting impending extinction and extirpation risks.

## Sections

### Model 1: Autocorrelation's Effect on Abundance and Risk Metrics
This model simulates the population dynamics of a logistically growing population with either a generalist or a specialist TPC experiencing different mean temperatures across various levels of temporal autocorrelation. Outputs: squence of population sizes and extinction times for every parameter set (Figure 3).

### Model 2: Extinction Risk Across the Thermal Landscape
This model simulations the population dynamics of a logistically growing population with either a generalist or a specialist TPC experiencing different mean and standard deviations of temperatures across various levels of temporal autocorrelation. Outputs: extinction times for every parameter set (Figure 4, 5).

### Model 3: Impacts of Autocorrelation on Global Risk Assessments
This model simulates the population dynamics of a logistically growing population with one of 38 empirical invetebrate TPCs experiencing historical (1994-2003) or recent (2014-2023) observed temperature regimes across various levels of temporal autocorrelation and realistic diurnal and seasonal cycles. Outputs: extinction times and minimum population size for every parameter set for each organism (Figure 6).
